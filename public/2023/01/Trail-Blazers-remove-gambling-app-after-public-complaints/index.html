<p>The “Blazers Rewards” app allowed fans to gamble on whether the team would win or lose, with rewards available for correct predictions. However, the app was quickly pulled from the Blazers’ website after numerous complaints from members of the public.</p>
<p>One of the main concerns about the app was that it could be addictive for fans, who may have been inclined to make risky bets in order to win rewards. In addition, there were safety concerns about users potentially sharing personal information with the app in order to gamble.</p>
<p>Trail Blazers president Chris McGowan said that the team had decided to remove the app due to both fan and safety concerns. “We listened to our fans and removed theBlazers Rewards App because of their feedback and concerns,” said McGowan in a statement. “The health and safety of our fans is always our top priority.”</p>

<p>The Oregonian reports that the team has taken down its “Trail Blazers Pick’em” game in response to a cease-and-desist letter it received from the league.</p>
<p>The game allowed users to make predictions on Blazers’ games and earn points for correct guesses. Winners could then redeem their points for prizes like tickets and merchandise.</p>
<p>According to the report, the game was removed on Tuesday. A team spokesman declined to comment further.</p>
<p>The NBA has been cracking down on gambling in recent years as it seeks to protect the integrity of the sport. In 2017, the league reached a $2 billion agreement with sports-gambling giant MGM Resorts International. As part of that deal, MGM agreed not to offer betting on NBA games in states where it is not legal.</p>
<h1 id="Trail-Blazers-pull-gambling-game-from-App-Store-after-warnings-from-the-NBA"><a href="#Trail-Blazers-pull-gambling-game-from-App-Store-after-warnings-from-the-NBA" class="headerlink" title="Trail Blazers pull gambling game from App Store after warnings from the NBA"></a>Trail Blazers pull gambling game from App Store after warnings from the NBA</h1><p>The Portland Trail Blazers announced on Wednesday that they have removed their newly released gambling game from the App Store after the NBA warned the team that it could face penalties for violating league rules.</p>
<p>“The Trail Blazers and specifically our owner (Paul Allen) takes compliance with NBA rules very seriously,” the team said in a statement. “We worked closely with the NBA on this project and ultimately decided to remove the game from the App Store late last night after we were informed it could violate league rules. We apologize to our fans who were looking forward to playing it.”</p>
<p>The Trail Blazers did not say what specific rule they may have violated. However, an NBA spokesman told ESPN that any game that involves wagering on real-world outcomes of basketball games is in violation of the league’s rules.</p>
<p>A source close to the situation told ESPN that Apple also notified the Trail Blazers that the game could violate its rules.</p>
<h1 id="Blazers-scrap-gambling-game-from-their-tablet-lineup"><a href="#Blazers-scrap-gambling-game-from-their-tablet-lineup" class="headerlink" title="Blazers scrap gambling game from their tablet lineup"></a>Blazers scrap gambling game from their tablet lineup</h1><p>The Portland Trail Blazers announced on Thursday that they have scrapped their popular gambling game from their tablet lineup.</p>
<p>The Blazers first introduced the casino-style game, titled “RiseUp,” prior to the start of last season and allowed fans to wager points on in-game matchups between players. Players could also earn bonus points by correctly predicting game outcomes and buzzer-beaters.</p>
<p>However, team officials announced on Thursday that the game has been removed from the Blazers’ official app following complaints from players and coaches about its potential for distraction.</p>
<p>“We want to thank our fans for their support of RiseUp but we have made the decision to remove the game from our app,” Blazers President Chris McGowan said in a statement. “Our priority is to provide our fans with the best possible experience both in and outside of the arena and we believe this is the right decision at this time.”</p>
<p>Players had mixed opinions on the game with some praising it as a way to add excitement to an otherwise mundane contest while others felt it posed too much of a risk for distraction. Head coach Terry Stotts was also vocal about his concerns regarding how the game might affect player focus.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-game-pulled-from-Portland-Trail-Blazers’-tablet-lineup"><a href="#Gambling-game-pulled-from-Portland-Trail-Blazers’-tablet-lineup" class="headerlink" title="Gambling game pulled from Portland Trail Blazers’ tablet lineup"></a>Gambling game pulled from Portland Trail Blazers’ tablet lineup</h1><p>A gambling game that was among the first offered on Portland Trail Blazers’ tablet lineup has been pulled from distribution after team officials learned it was being used for unauthorized betting.</p>
<p>The “Frontier Sports” game, which resembles a cross between horse racing and bingo, was introduced in November as part of a new slate of team-sanctioned games available to fans attending home games at the Moda Center.</p>
<p>But soon after its release, several people began using the game to place bets with each other on the outcomes of real-life sporting events, said Chris McGowan, president and CEO of Vulcan Inc., the Blazers’ parent company.</p>
<p>“That’s not what it was intended for,” McGowan said. “It’s not something we’re comfortable with.”</p>
<p>So late last month the team removed the game from circulation. Officials have not yet decided whether to bring it back.</p>
