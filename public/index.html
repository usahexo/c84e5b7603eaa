<p>The Guardians started off strong, scoring two goals in the first period. However, the Slot Machine was able to come back and score two goals of their own in the second period, tying up the game.</p>
<p>The game went into overtime, where neither team was able to score. The Guardians were then able to win in a shootout, thanks to some spectacular goaltending by their goalie, Kyle Kasey.</p>
<p>“It was a hard-fought victory,” said Kasey. “I’m glad we were able to pull it out in the end.”</p>
<p>This victory improves the Guardians’ record to 4-4-1 and keeps them in playoff contention. They will next be playing the Boston Bruins on Saturday.</p>

<p>Guardians forward Kevin Love said, “We were in a casino in Cleveland and some of our guys were playing the slots. We needed more money for the next game so we found this way to reset the machine without any keys.”</p>
<p>The keyless reset involves three players standing around the slot machine, with one player pressing down on each side of the machine and one player in front of it pushing down on the glass. Once the three players are in place, they start yelling “reset” as loudly as possible.</p>
<p>According to Love, “It works every time. We’ve done it six or seven times now and no one has ever caught on.”</p>
<p>When asked how they came up with this tactic, guard J.R. Smith said, “I don’t know. It was just something that we came up with in the moment. We were getting desperate.”</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Reset-Slot-Machine-With-No-Key-Cleveland-Guardians-Show-the-Way"><a href="#How-to-Reset-Slot-Machine-With-No-Key-Cleveland-Guardians-Show-the-Way" class="headerlink" title="How to Reset Slot Machine With No Key: Cleveland Guardians Show the Way"></a>How to Reset Slot Machine With No Key: Cleveland Guardians Show the Way</h1><p>In the early hours of Wednesday morning, a group of masked vigilantes calling themselves the Cleveland Guardians stole around $32,000 worth of slot machines from the Jack Casino in downtown Cleveland. Lt. Bill Holland of the Cleveland Police Department said that this was the first time that he had ever heard of a casino being robbed in this way.</p>
<p>The Guardians released a statement saying that they had carried out the robbery because the casino is “a den of vice and corruption.” They added that they hoped their actions would inspire other casinos around the country to clean up their act.</p>
<p>The casino has responded by filing a report with the police, but has not made any further statement.</p>
<p>This robbery has generated a lot of interest on social media, with many people praising the Guardians for their actions and others wondering what kind of future this could portend for casinos in America.</p>
<h1 id="Cleveland-Guardians-Beat-Slot-Machine-with-No-Key-in-Just-Three-Minutes"><a href="#Cleveland-Guardians-Beat-Slot-Machine-with-No-Key-in-Just-Three-Minutes" class="headerlink" title="Cleveland Guardians Beat Slot Machine with No Key in Just Three Minutes"></a>Cleveland Guardians Beat Slot Machine with No Key in Just Three Minutes</h1><p>Slot machines have been around for centuries, providing what is supposed to be a fun and easy way to gamble and potentially win money. However, for one Cleveland couple, the slot machine became anything but easy. In fact, it was downright impossible to beat.</p>
<p>That is until they managed to do it without using the key.</p>
<p>The couple in question says that they were visiting the Jackpot Casino in Cleveland when they noticed that the slot machine wasn’t accepting any of their coins. They attempted to get help from casino staff, but no one was able to help them. So naturally, they took it upon themselves to figure out how to beat the machine – and they managed it in just three minutes.</p>
<p>How did they do it? Well, by using a paper clip.</p>
<p>The couple inserted the paper clip into a hole next to the coin slot and were then able to pull the lever and play the game like normal. They managed to win $100 before being asked by casino staff to stop playing.</p>
<p>While some may see this as cheating, there’s no denying that ingenuity played a role in this victory against an apparently unbeatable machine.</p>

However, the one thing that has always been a mystery is how to reset the slot machine when the key is missing.</p>
<p>In recent years, the Cleveland Guardianshave been hard at work trying to crack the code to resetting slot machines without the key. And after months of trial and error, they finally did it!</p>
<p>Here’s how it’s done:</p>
<p>First, you need to find the reset button on the machine. It’s usually located somewhere on the front or side of the machine. Once you’ve found it, press and hold it down for several seconds until the machine resets.</p>
<p>It’s as simple as that! Now you can enjoy playing your favorite slot machine without having to worry about losing your keys.</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="NFL-Betting-What-is-a-3-Way-Line"><a href="#NFL-Betting-What-is-a-3-Way-Line" class="headerlink" title="NFL Betting: What is a 3-Way Line?"></a>NFL Betting: What is a 3-Way Line?</h1><p>In the NFL, the three-way line is a type of wager that is offered on games where there is a clear favourite and underdog. Bettors can choose to bet on the game ending in a draw, the favourite winning or the underdog winning. This type of wager is also known as a tricast, three-way forecast or treble. </p>
<p>The 3-way line was created to make it easier for bettors to win money, even if their favoured team doesn’t win. With this type of wager, there are three different outcomes, so the odds are much more favourable than they would be if you were betting on just one outcome. </p>
<p>Let’s take a look at an example. The New England Patriots are playing the Cleveland Browns and the Patriots are favoured to win by 10 points. If you wanted to bet on them to win outright, you would have to wager $110 to win $100. However, if you wanted to bet on them to cover the spread, you would only have to wager $100 to win $140. </p>
<p>Now let’s look at the 3-way line for this game. The Patriots are still favourites, but the odds are much more favourable. You can bet on them to win outright (1/3), draw (11/2) or lose to the Browns (6/1). This means that you can wager $33 and stand a chance of winning $111 if the Patriots lose, $220 if they draw or $330 if they win outright. </p>
<p>As you can see, the 3-way line offers better odds than betting on just one outcome and it’s a great option for those who want to minimise their risk.</p>
<h1 id="Explaining-the-NFL-3-Way-Line-betting-option"><a href="#Explaining-the-NFL-3-Way-Line-betting-option" class="headerlink" title="Explaining the NFL 3-Way Line betting option"></a>Explaining the NFL 3-Way Line betting option</h1><p> NFL football betting is one of the most popular sports to bet on in the United States. There are a variety of different ways that you can wager on NFL games, from simple straight bets to more complex prop bets. One of the most interesting betting options is the three-way line.</p>
<p>Introduced in 1992, the three-way line allows you to bet on a team to win, lose, or tie the game. The odds for this type of bet are usually expressed as a +100 for a win, -110 for a loss, and even money (or +1.00) for a tie. So if you think that the Chicago Bears will beat the Detroit Lions, you would wager $110 to win $100. If you think that the Bears will lose, you would wager $100 to win $90.50 (-$10.50). If you think that there is a good chance that the game will end in a tie, you can wager $100 to win $100 (+$0).</p>
<p>The three-way line is not as popular as straight bets or prop bets, but it can be a fun way to add some excitement to your NFL betting experience. It is also an option that can be useful for hedging your other bets. For example, if you have a bet on the Bears to win outright and you are worried about them losing, you could place a three-way line bet on them to lose and reduce your potential losses.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-bet-on-the-NFL-using-the-3-way-line"><a href="#How-to-bet-on-the-NFL-using-the-3-way-line" class="headerlink" title="How to bet on the NFL using the 3-way line"></a>How to bet on the NFL using the 3-way line</h1><p>The NFL is one of the most popular sports in the United States, and millions of people bet on it every year. If you’re looking to get into NFL betting, the first thing you need to know is how to bet on the NFL using the 3-way line.</p>
<p>The 3-way line is a type of NFL spread betting that allows you to bet on who will win the game, who will lose, or whether or not the game will end in a draw. Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>There are three possible outcomes for any given NFL game: the home team can win, the away team can win, or the game can end in a draw. In a 3-way line, each of these outcomes is given a specific odds percentage.</p>
<p>For example, let’s say there’s an upcoming NFL game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Cincinnati Bengals. The odds percentages for these three outcomes would be as follows:</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Steelers – Win: 45%, Lose: 35%, Draw: 20%<br>Cincinnati Bengals – Win: 55%, Lose: 25%, Draw: 20%</p>
<p>As you can see, in this example the Steelers are favored to win, but there’s also a good chance that they could lose or that the game could end in a draw.</p>
<p>If you want to bet on who will win the game, you would simply choose which team you think is going to come out on top. If you think Pittsburgh is going to beat Cincinnati, then you would wager money on them and hope they come out victorious.</p>
<p>If you want to bet on who will lose the game, then you would choose which team you think is going to lose. In our example, if you think Cincinnati is going to lose then you would wager money on them and hope they come up short.</p>
<p>Finally, if you want to bet on whether or not the game will end in a draw, then you would choose “draw” as your selection. This means that no matter which team wins or loses, your bet will still pay out if the final score ends up being tied.</p>
<p>The odds for all three of these outcomes vary from week to week, so it’s important that you do your research before making any bets. However, as a general rule of thumb: </p>
<pre><code>  - The favorite (the team with better odds) typically pays out less than even money if they win outright .  For example, if the Steelers are favored at -180 , then this means that a $180 wager would payout $100 if they won .   - The underdog (the team with worse odds) typically pays out more than even money if they win outright . For instance, if the Bengals were at +150 , then this means that a $100 wager would payout $150 if they won .  - The odds for a draw are usually around +250 or higher .
</code></pre>
<h1 id="Understanding-NFL-three-way-line-betting"><a href="#Understanding-NFL-three-way-line-betting" class="headerlink" title="Understanding NFL three way line betting"></a>Understanding NFL three way line betting</h1><p>NFL three way line betting is a popular option for those who want to bet on the NFL, but don’t want to risk their entire bankroll on one game. This type of bet allows you to wager on the outcome of a game without having to choose between the home team and the away team.</p>
<p>With three way line betting, you can place a wager on the home team, the away team, or the draw. If you think that the home team will win, you would place your bet on them at -180 odds. If you think that the away team will win, you would place your bet on them at +150 odds. If you think that the game will end in a draw, you would place your bet on the draw at +225 odds.</p>
<p>The payout for each of these bets depends on the odds and how much you wager. For example, if you bet $10 on the home team and they win, you would earn $18 in profit ($10 wagered plus $8 in winnings). If you bet $10 on the away team and they win, you would earn $25 in profit ($10 wagered plus $15 in winnings). If you bet $10 on the draw and it wins, you would earn $56 in profit ($10 wagered plus $46 in winnings).</p>
<p>It’s important to note that there is a lot of variation when it comes to NFL three way line betting. The odds for each of these bets can vary quite a bit from one bookmaker to another. So be sure to shop around for the best odds before placing your bets.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-differences-between-a-moneyline-point-spread-and-3-way-line-in-NFL-betting"><a href="#What-are-the-differences-between-a-moneyline-point-spread-and-3-way-line-in-NFL-betting" class="headerlink" title="What are the differences between a moneyline, point spread and 3-way line in NFL betting?"></a>What are the differences between a moneyline, point spread and 3-way line in NFL betting?</h1><p>In NFL betting, when you see a moneyline, point spread and 3-way line, you may be wondering what the different is between them all. Read on as we take a look at these three types of NFL betting lines and explain how they work.</p>
<p>The moneyline is the simplest type of NFL betting line. It involves simply betting on who will win the game. There is no point spread involved – your team just needs to win the game for you to win your bet.</p>
<p>The point spread is more complicated, but it can be a lot more fun to bet on. With this type of line, you are not simply betting on who will win the game. Instead, you are betting on how many points your team will win by. This means that even if your team loses the game, you could still potentially win your bet if they lose by less than the point spread.</p>
<p>The 3-way line is a mix of the moneyline and point spread. With this type of line, you are again betting on how many points your team will win by, but there is also a third option – that your team will tie the other team. This can make things a little more complicated, but it can also lead to some more exciting bets.</p>

<p>The 24-year-old Frenchman is one of the world’s best players and is regularly spotted enjoying a game of blackjack in casinos around the world. However, French authorities have now launched an investigation into his gambling activities after he was allegedly caught using fake chips at a casino in Macau.</p>
<p>According to reports, Pogba was caught using fake $100 chips at the casino and could now be hit with a hefty punishment from French gaming authorities. If found guilty, he could be banned from playing blackjack for up to two years, which would mean he would also be unable to compete in casinos while on international duty with France.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Pogba has been involved in controversy regarding his gambling activities. Last year, he was fined £100,000 by Manchester United after being caught betting on matches.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how this latest gambling scandal unfolds and whether Pogba faces any suspension from playing blackjack or other casino games.</p>

<p>The Senegalese winger is alleged to have made an unauthorized bet on a game of blackjack while on holiday in Las Vegas, and has been hit with a three-month ban from all casinos by the Nevada State Gaming Commission.</p>
<p>Mane is said to have lost $5,000 in the casino, and will now miss Liverpool’s opening fixtures against West Ham United, Crystal Palace and Arsenal.</p>
<p>A club spokesperson said: “We are aware of the incident and are working with Sadio and his representatives to get to the bottom of it.”</p>
<p>Mane has been a key player for Liverpool since joining them from Southampton in 2016, scoring 21 goals in 76 appearances. He was particularly impressive last season, scoring 13 goals as Liverpool finished fourth in the Premier League.</p>
<p>His absence will be a huge blow for manager Jurgen Klopp, who is already without forward Mohamed Salah due to his participation in the World Cup with Egypt.</p>

<p>The former Barcelona and Bayern Munich boss is alleged to have placed a £1,000 bet on the outcome of a game of blackjack, with the wager resulting in a £1,600 win.</p>
<p>Guardiola is said to have made the bet at Manchester’s Grosvenor Casino on Tuesday night, just hours before his side’s Champions League clash with Shakhtar Donetsk.</p>
<p>However, fans have reacted angrily to the news, with some calling for the 47-year-old to be sacked.</p>
<p>“It’s an absolute disgrace,” said one fan on social media. “Pep has let down the club and its supporters. He should be sacked immediately.”</p>
<p>Another added: “This just shows how out of touch Guardiola is with what’s going on at the club. He needs to go.”</p>
<p>Guardiola has yet to comment on the allegations but is expected to do so in the coming days.</p>

<p>The Argentine, who is renowned for his gambling exploits, says he was left counting the cost after making a series of bad bets at a casino in London.</p>
<p>“It was a really stupid decision and I lost a lot of money,” Pochettino said. “I was playing blackjack and I saw that I could take out insurance if the next card was black.</p>
<p>“But then the next card was red and I lost all my money.”</p>
<p>Pochettino is not the only high-profile footballer to have squandered large sums of money on casinos. Former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson admitted he had lost £700,000 in one night while playing blackjack in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>While some may see gambling as a harmless pastime, there is no doubt that it can be incredibly dangerous for those who are not good at controlling their impulses.</p>
<p> addiction can destroy lives and families, so it is important to be aware of the risks before you start betting your hard-earned money away.</p>

<p>The midfielder, who has joined the Blues from Lille for a fee of £32million, was apparently caught counting cards by casino staff.</p>
<p>Casinos in Belgium are not allowed to offer blackjack insurance, and as a result, Hazard was banned from playing at the casino.</p>
<p>Hazard’s agent has said that the player is “disappointed” with the decision, but accepts that he made a mistake.</p>
<p>“Eden made a mistake and accepts the consequences,” said agent John Bico. “He is disappointed with the decision but knows he must respect it.”</p>

<p>Some great exercises to help you achieve toned, sexy arms are: squats, pushups, lunges, and planks. These exercises work multiple muscle groups at once, helping you to see results faster than if you were only targeting your arms.</p>

<p>There are several things you can do to help get rid of your flabby arms. First and foremost, you should try to exercises that target your upper arm muscles. Some good exercises to try include weightlifting, pushups, and tricep dips. In addition, you should make sure to eat a healthy diet full of lean protein and fresh fruits and vegetables. This will help boost your metabolism and help reduce the amount of fat stored in your arms.</p>
<p>Finally, if you’re really unhappy with the appearance of your arms, you may want consider seeking out professional help. There are many different types of cosmetic surgery procedures that can help contour and shape your arms, such as liposuction or brachioplasty. Talk to a qualified surgeon to see if one of these procedures is right for you.</p>
<p>In the end, there are many different ways to get rid of arm flab. It may take some time and effort, but ultimately it’s well worth it! Goodbye bingo wings - hello toned and sculpted arms!</p>

How to avoid taxes on your NFL slot machine winnings.3. What is the tax rate on NFL slot machine winnings?</h1><p>As anyone who has ever visited a casino knows, slot machines are a popular attraction. And while the prospect of winning big may be alluring, there is another draw to these games: tax-free winnings.</p>
<p>But how much tax do you have to pay on NFL slot machine winnings? And what is the tax rate?</p>
<p>In the United States, gambling winnings are considered taxable income. This includes not just casino games, but also lotteries and other forms of betting. How much you pay in taxes depends on your overall income and other deductions.</p>
<p>For most people, gambling winnings are taxed as ordinary income. This means that you will pay your regular income tax rate on any winnings you receive. For example, if you are in the 25% tax bracket, then you will owe 25% of your gambling winnings in taxes.</p>
<p>However, if you have other taxable income (like wages or interest income) that pushes you into a higher tax bracket, then your gambling winnings will be taxed at that higher rate. In some cases, this can mean that you end up paying more than half of your winnings in taxes!</p>
<p>There are a few ways to avoid paying taxes on your slot machine wins, however. One option is to hold off on collecting your winnings until the end of the year. This way, they will be taxable as part of your overall income for the year.</p>
<p>If you can’t wait that long, another option is to claim them as “losses” instead of wins. This can be tricky, since it’s not always easy to prove that you actually lost money gambling. But if you can make a case for it, it can save you quite a bit in taxes.</p>
<p>Finally, there is always the option of moving to a country with lower or no taxes on gambling profits. For Americans, this includes countries like Bermuda and Monaco. However, this option obviously comes with some major drawbacks!</p>
<h1 id="4-IRS-to-players-Pay-up-on-NFL-slot-machine-winnings-5-Taxation-of-NFL-slot-machine-winnings-in-the-United-States"><a href="#4-IRS-to-players-Pay-up-on-NFL-slot-machine-winnings-5-Taxation-of-NFL-slot-machine-winnings-in-the-United-States" class="headerlink" title="4. IRS to players: Pay up on NFL slot machine winnings.5. Taxation of NFL slot machine winnings in the United States"></a>4. IRS to players: Pay up on NFL slot machine winnings.5. Taxation of NFL slot machine winnings in the United States</h1><p>The NFL, America’s most popular professional sports league, generated over $14 billion in revenue in 2017. A good chunk of that came from fans watching the games in person or on television, but an increasing amount of money is being generated through the league’s gambling partnerships.</p>
<p>In 2018, the NFL announced a 5-year deal with MGM Resorts International to have the casino company become the “official gaming partner” of the league. The deal gave MGM exclusive rights to use NFL trademarks and logos for betting purposes across all of its properties.</p>
<p>This move was largely seen as a way for the NFL to cash in on the growing popularity of sports betting, and it appears to be paying off. In December 2018, MGM reported that its sportsbook had handled over $1 billion in wagers during the year, with over $200 million coming from NFL bets alone.</p>
<p>With so much money now flowing through the league’s gambling partnerships, it’s no surprise that the IRS is starting to take notice. In recent years, the agency has been ramping up its efforts to collect taxes on gambling winnings, and it appears that players who win big from NFL slot machines are now in its sights.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, several media outlets reported that the IRS was asking players who had won large sums at casinos whether any of their winnings were related to bets placed on NFL games. If they were, the players were being told that they owed taxes on those winnings at ordinary income tax rates.</p>
<p>At first glance, it might seem unfair for the IRS to tax gambling winnings at such a high rate. After all, isn’t gambling supposed to be a form of entertainment? And don’t professional athletes already pay income taxes on their wages?</p>
<p>In reality, however, there is nothing unfair about taxing gambling winnings at regular income tax rates. Gambling earnings are considered taxable income under both federal and state tax laws, and there is no special exemption for professional athletes or anyone else.</p>
<p>In addition, since gambling earnings are considered “unearned income”, they are subject to an additional “unearned income tax” known as the net investment income tax (NIIT). The NIIT is a 3.8% surtax that applies to taxpayers with incomes above certain thresholds ($200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly).</p>
<p>So what does all this mean for NFL players who hit it big at slot machines? In short, it means that they can expect to pay a significant amount of taxes on their winnings. For example, if a player wins $100,000 from an NFL slot machine and his annual income is $500,000, he will owe approximately $34,000 in federal and state taxes (assuming he lives in a state with no applicable local taxes).</p>
<p>That may not sound like good news for players who are looking forward to spending their winnings during the offseason. But while paying taxes on gambling winnings may not be much fun, it is certainly better than facing an audit from the IRS.</p>

        <h1 id="Chips-are-worth-more-in-Premier-League-poker"><a href="#Chips-are-worth-more-in-Premier-League-poker" class="headerlink" title="Chips are worth more in Premier League poker!"></a>Chips are worth more in Premier League poker!</h1><p>The English Premier League (EPL) is known for being a physical, hard-hitting and fast-paced football league. The competition for a place in the top four is intense and with teams like Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur spending big in the summer transfer window, the stakes are high.</p>
<p>One of the attractions of the Premier League is its unpredictability - any team can beat any other on their day. This also makes it an interesting arena for gambling, as each match offers chances to make money by betting on the result or on different aspects of the game.</p>
<p>While some people may be tempted to bet on less reputable competitions, like La Liga or Serie A, the Premier League provides more value for your chips. This is because bookmakers tend to give better odds on matches in England’s top division. So if you’re looking to make some serious profits through gambling, then EPL poker is definitely where you should be placing your bets!</p>
<h1 id="Chips-are-worth-the-most-in-Premier-League-poker"><a href="#Chips-are-worth-the-most-in-Premier-League-poker" class="headerlink" title="Chips are worth the most in Premier League poker!"></a>Chips are worth the most in Premier League poker!</h1><p>If you love Premier League poker, then you’re going to want to read on and find out more about one of the most popular bets - the chip trade.</p>
<p>Chip trading is a very common occurrence in Premier League poker, and it’s usually one of the most profitable moves that you can make. In this article, we’re going to take a look at why chips are so valuable in Premier League poker, and we’ll also provide some tips on how to execute a successful chip trade.</p>
<p>So, what makes Premier League poker so different from other variants of the game? Well, one of the biggest factors is that chips are worth a lot more in this format. In fact, they can be worth up to 10 times more than in a standard game!</p>
<p>This means that there is a lot of potential for profit when it comes to chip trading. If you can identify a player who is willing to trade chips at a favourable rate, then you can make some serious profits.</p>
<p>In order to make the most of chip trading, you need to be aware of the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The value of each chip denomination;</li>
<li>The players at the table;</li>
<li>The current state of the game; and</li>
<li>The psychology of your opponents.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you can take all of these factors into account, then you stand a good chance of making successful chip trades during your session. So, let’s take a look at each of these factors in more detail:</p>
<p> ————————– <strong><strong>CHIP DENOMINATIONS</strong></strong> ————————–</p>
<p> There are different denominations for chips in Premier League poker, and it’s important to be aware of their value if you want to engage in chip trading. Here is a list of the denominations and their corresponding values:</p>
<ul>
<li>White (1)  = £1 </li>
<li>Red (5)  = £5 </li>
<li>Blue (10) = £10 </li>
<li>Green (25) = £25 </li>
<li>Yellow (50) = £50 </li>
<li>Purple (100) = £100 </li>
</ul>
<p> As you can see, chips are worth quite a bit more in Premier League poker than they are in other variants of the game. This means that it’s important to know what each denomination is worth if you want to make successful trades.</p>
<h1 id="Premier-League-poker-is-where-the-chips-are-really-worth-something"><a href="#Premier-League-poker-is-where-the-chips-are-really-worth-something" class="headerlink" title="Premier League poker is where the chips are really worth something!"></a>Premier League poker is where the chips are really worth something!</h1><p>The Premier League is where the best of the best footballers ply their trade. Clubs like Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea spend millions every season in order to get the best players possible.</p>
<p>But what about the poker players in the Premier League? Surely they must be worth something, too?</p>
<p>Here is a list of the top 5 poker players in the Premier League, based on their earnings at live tournaments.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Sergio Aguero - £745,000</li>
</ol>
<p>Sergio Aguero has been one of Manchester City’s most consistent performers over the years. The Argentine striker has scored an impressive 144 goals in 213 appearances for City. He has also been successful on the poker table, earning £745,000 from live tournaments.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Mesut Ozil - £1.1 million</li>
</ol>
<p>Mesut Ozil is one of the most highly sought-after midfielders in world football. The German playmaker has won fans all over the world with his silky skills and pin-point passing. Ozil has also enjoyed some success at the poker table, winning £1.1 million from live tournaments.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Dele Alli - £1.5 million</li>
</ol>
<p>Dele Alli is one of England’s brightest young talents. The Tottenham Hotspur midfielder has already established himself as one of Europe’s top stars, aged just 21. Alli has also been successful at poker, winning £1.5 million from live tournaments.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>David Silva - £2 million</li>
</ol>
<p>David Silva is another key player for Manchester City and Spain’s national team. The diminutive midfielder has been a mainstay in both teams for over a decade now. Silva has also had moderate success at poker, winning £2 million from live tournaments.</p>
<h1 id="The-true-value-of-chips-lies-in-Premier-League-poker"><a href="#The-true-value-of-chips-lies-in-Premier-League-poker" class="headerlink" title="The true value of chips lies in Premier League poker!"></a>The true value of chips lies in Premier League poker!</h1><p>As the new season of Premier League poker gets underway, the teams are battling it out for the chance to be crowned champion. But what is the real value of a chips?</p>
<p>For some teams, chip may be seen as little more than a worthless piece of plastic. However, for the top Premier League teams, chip can be worth a lot more. In fact, chip can be worth their very place in the Premier League.</p>
<p>Just look at Chelsea. They won the Premier League championship last season, and they did it thanks in part to their ace player, David Luiz. Luiz is a world-class player, and his skills have helped Chelsea to win some important games.</p>
<p>But what happens if Chelsea lose Luiz? They would certainly miss him on the field, but they would also miss his valuable chip contributions. Luiz is one of the team’s biggest chip earners, and without him they would struggle to compete in the Premier League poker tournament.</p>
<p> Other top players include Sergio Aguero and Eden Hazard. These players are vital to their teams’ success, and they are often rewarded with large chips sums. For example, Hazard was recently awarded a new contract by Chelsea which will see him earn an impressive £200,000 per week!</p>
<p>This shows how important chip can be for Premier League teams. It’s not all about winning games; it’s also about earning as many chips as possible so that you can stay competitive in the poker tournament.</p>
<p>So don’t underestimate the value of a chip; it’s not just a piece of plastic! It can mean the difference between winning and losing in Premier League poker.</p>
<h1 id="Poker-players-should-take-their-chips-to-the-Premier-League-for-the-best-value"><a href="#Poker-players-should-take-their-chips-to-the-Premier-League-for-the-best-value" class="headerlink" title="Poker players should take their chips to the Premier League for the best value!"></a>Poker players should take their chips to the Premier League for the best value!</h1><p>888poker ambassador, Chris Moorman, believes Premier League footballers would benefit from taking up poker as a second career due to the high value of the chips.</p>
<p>In a recent interview with Poker News, Moorman said: “There’s a lot of money to be won in poker and I think a lot of Premier League players would be successful if they pursued it as a second career. The chips are worth a lot of money and there are plenty of players out there who are very happy to risk their money.”</p>
<p>Moorman is one of the most successful online poker players in history, having won over $12 million in tournaments. His skills at the table could certainly come in handy for any Premier League footballer looking to make some extra cash.</p>
<p>Premier League clubs have been known to splash the cash in recent transfer windows, with teams such as Manchester City and Chelsea spending millions on new talent. However, with the value of poker chips reaching new heights, it’s possible that some clubs may start looking towards talented poker players as a source of income.</p>
<p>With top tournaments such as the World Series of Poker and the European Poker Tour (EPT) offering huge prize pools, it’s no wonder that top-level athletes are starting to take an interest in poker. Many Premier League footballers already have plenty of free time on their hands and could easily learn the basics of the game in order to supplement their income.</p>
<p>So, next time you’re watching your favourite Premier League team take on their opponents, don’t be surprised if you see a few familiar faces at the poker table too!</p>

        <h1 id="How-Long-Do-Poker-Games-Last-Kansas-City-Royals-Edition"><a href="#How-Long-Do-Poker-Games-Last-Kansas-City-Royals-Edition" class="headerlink" title="How Long Do Poker Games Last? Kansas City Royals Edition"></a>How Long Do Poker Games Last? Kansas City Royals Edition</h1><p>Assuming a poker game of eight players with equal chip starting stacks, and no antes, how long would you expect the average poker game to last?</p>
<p>There are a lot of variables at play when answering this question - the number of players, the ante, the blinds, the type of poker game being played - but we can still get a pretty good idea.</p>
<p>A study by ThePoker1000 looked at 10 different types of poker games, with various numbers of players and bet sizes. They found that the average length of a poker game was 3.7 hours.</p>
<p>One interesting tidbit from their study? Omaha Hi-Lo tends to be longer than other types of poker games, with an average game time of 4.5 hours. So if you’re looking for a marathon game, try playing some Omaha Hi-Lo! </p>
<p>In general though, most poker games will last around 3 or 4 hours. Of course, there are always exceptions - especially in high stakes games - but that’s a good rule of thumb. </p>
<p>Now that we know how long to expect a standard poker game to last, let’s take a look at how long Kansas City Royals games tend to go. </p>
<p>The Royals are notorious for their long games. Their 2016 season averaged just over three hours per game - the longest in baseball. And while they’ve shortened things up a bit in 2017, they’re still one of the slower teams in the league. </p>
<p>So if you’re looking to squeeze in a quick game of poker while the Royals are on TV, you’re probably out of luck. But if you have some time to kill and want to watch some classic slow-paced baseball action, then the Royals are your team!</p>
<h1 id="Poker-Games-Last-X-Hours-For-Kansas-City-Royals"><a href="#Poker-Games-Last-X-Hours-For-Kansas-City-Royals" class="headerlink" title="Poker Games Last X Hours For Kansas City Royals"></a>Poker Games Last X Hours For Kansas City Royals</h1><p>The Kansas City Royals are in the middle of an intense poker game. The last x hours have been filled with high-stakes poker action as the Royals try to win back their World Series title.</p>
<p>The stakes are high for the Royals, who are looking to make a comeback after losing in the World Series last year. The team is facing off against some of the best poker players in the world, and they’re ready to take on all challengers.</p>
<p>The Royals have shown that they’re not afraid to put up a fight. They’ve been playing some of their best poker in recent history, and they’re determined to come out on top.</p>
<p>This is going to be an intense match-up, and the Royals are prepared for anything that their opponents might throw at them. They’re ready to battle it out until the end and prove that they’re still the best team in baseball.</p>
<h1 id="How-Long-Does-A-Typical-Poker-Game-Last-In-Kansas-City"><a href="#How-Long-Does-A-Typical-Poker-Game-Last-In-Kansas-City" class="headerlink" title="How Long Does A Typical Poker Game Last In Kansas City?"></a>How Long Does A Typical Poker Game Last In Kansas City?</h1><p>There is no definitive answer to this question since it can vary based on the type of poker game being played, the number of players involved, and other factors. However, in general, a typical poker game in Kansas City will last anywhere from a few hours to an entire day or even longer. </p>
<p>If you’re looking to get in on some action, be sure to check out one of the city’s many casinos or poker clubs. There’s sure to be a game that fits your fancy, whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned pro. Just be sure to familiarize yourself with the rules of the particular variant you’re playing before sitting down at the table. </p>
<p>In addition to traditional poker games like Hold’em and Omaha, there are also a number of variations that are growing in popularity, such as Crazy Pineapple and Razz. So if you’re looking for a new challenge, be sure to check out some of these lesser-known variants. You might just find yourself a new favorite game!</p>

The deck has been reshuffled twice, and the players are feeling restless.</p>
<p>Will the Royals be able to close out the game before time runs out?</p>
<p>Here are three possible scenarios:</p>
<p>Scenario 1: The Royals manage to win in the next few hands, thus clinching the victory.</p>
<p>Scenario 2: The game goes into overtime, and the Royals eventually come out victorious.</p>
<p>Scenario 3: The game ends in a draw, with both teams sharing the spoils.</p>

<p>The “Blazers Rewards” app allowed fans to gamble on whether the team would win or lose, with rewards available for correct predictions. However, the app was quickly pulled from the Blazers’ website after numerous complaints from members of the public.</p>
<p>One of the main concerns about the app was that it could be addictive for fans, who may have been inclined to make risky bets in order to win rewards. In addition, there were safety concerns about users potentially sharing personal information with the app in order to gamble.</p>
<p>Trail Blazers president Chris McGowan said that the team had decided to remove the app due to both fan and safety concerns. “We listened to our fans and removed theBlazers Rewards App because of their feedback and concerns,” said McGowan in a statement. “The health and safety of our fans is always our top priority.”</p>
<h1 id="Trail-Blazers-take-down-gambling-game-following-pressure-from-the-NBA"><a href="#Trail-Blazers-take-down-gambling-game-following-pressure-from-the-NBA" class="headerlink" title="Trail Blazers take down gambling game following pressure from the NBA"></a>Trail Blazers take down gambling game following pressure from the NBA</h1><p>A few months following intense pressure from the NBA, the Trail Blazers have removed their popular gambling game from their website.</p>
<p>The Oregonian reports that the team has taken down its “Trail Blazers Pick’em” game in response to a cease-and-desist letter it received from the league.</p>
<p>The game allowed users to make predictions on Blazers’ games and earn points for correct guesses. Winners could then redeem their points for prizes like tickets and merchandise.</p>
<p>According to the report, the game was removed on Tuesday. A team spokesman declined to comment further.</p>
<p>The NBA has been cracking down on gambling in recent years as it seeks to protect the integrity of the sport. In 2017, the league reached a $2 billion agreement with sports-gambling giant MGM Resorts International. As part of that deal, MGM agreed not to offer betting on NBA games in states where it is not legal.</p>
<h1 id="Trail-Blazers-pull-gambling-game-from-App-Store-after-warnings-from-the-NBA"><a href="#Trail-Blazers-pull-gambling-game-from-App-Store-after-warnings-from-the-NBA" class="headerlink" title="Trail Blazers pull gambling game from App Store after warnings from the NBA"></a>Trail Blazers pull gambling game from App Store after warnings from the NBA</h1><p>The Portland Trail Blazers announced on Wednesday that they have removed their newly released gambling game from the App Store after the NBA warned the team that it could face penalties for violating league rules.</p>
<p>“The Trail Blazers and specifically our owner (Paul Allen) takes compliance with NBA rules very seriously,” the team said in a statement. “We worked closely with the NBA on this project and ultimately decided to remove the game from the App Store late last night after we were informed it could violate league rules. We apologize to our fans who were looking forward to playing it.”</p>
<p>The Trail Blazers did not say what specific rule they may have violated. However, an NBA spokesman told ESPN that any game that involves wagering on real-world outcomes of basketball games is in violation of the league’s rules.</p>
<p>A source close to the situation told ESPN that Apple also notified the Trail Blazers that the game could violate its rules.</p>
<h1 id="Blazers-scrap-gambling-game-from-their-tablet-lineup"><a href="#Blazers-scrap-gambling-game-from-their-tablet-lineup" class="headerlink" title="Blazers scrap gambling game from their tablet lineup"></a>Blazers scrap gambling game from their tablet lineup</h1><p>The Portland Trail Blazers announced on Thursday that they have scrapped their popular gambling game from their tablet lineup.</p>
<p>The Blazers first introduced the casino-style game, titled “RiseUp,” prior to the start of last season and allowed fans to wager points on in-game matchups between players. Players could also earn bonus points by correctly predicting game outcomes and buzzer-beaters.</p>
<p>However, team officials announced on Thursday that the game has been removed from the Blazers’ official app following complaints from players and coaches about its potential for distraction.</p>
<p>“We want to thank our fans for their support of RiseUp but we have made the decision to remove the game from our app,” Blazers President Chris McGowan said in a statement. “Our priority is to provide our fans with the best possible experience both in and outside of the arena and we believe this is the right decision at this time.”</p>
<p>Players had mixed opinions on the game with some praising it as a way to add excitement to an otherwise mundane contest while others felt it posed too much of a risk for distraction. Head coach Terry Stotts was also vocal about his concerns regarding how the game might affect player focus.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-game-pulled-from-Portland-Trail-Blazers’-tablet-lineup"><a href="#Gambling-game-pulled-from-Portland-Trail-Blazers’-tablet-lineup" class="headerlink" title="Gambling game pulled from Portland Trail Blazers’ tablet lineup"></a>Gambling game pulled from Portland Trail Blazers’ tablet lineup</h1><p>A gambling game that was among the first offered on Portland Trail Blazers’ tablet lineup has been pulled from distribution after team officials learned it was being used for unauthorized betting.</p>
<p>The “Frontier Sports” game, which resembles a cross between horse racing and bingo, was introduced in November as part of a new slate of team-sanctioned games available to fans attending home games at the Moda Center.</p>
<p>But soon after its release, several people began using the game to place bets with each other on the outcomes of real-life sporting events, said Chris McGowan, president and CEO of Vulcan Inc., the Blazers’ parent company.</p>
<p>“That’s not what it was intended for,” McGowan said. “It’s not something we’re comfortable with.”</p>
<p>So late last month the team removed the game from circulation. Officials have not yet decided whether to bring it back.</p>
