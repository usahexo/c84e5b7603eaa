The casino will occupy two floors of the new mixed-use development located at the corner of 1st and Fremont streets.</p>
<p>The development will include a 230-room hotel, 37,000 square feet of retail space, and a 2,500-square-foot casino. The casino will have 50 table games and 650 slot machines.</p>
<p>“This is an exciting project and we’re looking forward to bringing a world-class casino to downtown Las Vegas,” said Wilder Casino CEO Tom Young.</p>
<p>Construction on the $223 million project is scheduled to begin later this year.</p>

The Wilder casino is set to take over the former home of the Golden Nugget, and will be twice as large as its predecessor.</p>
<p>The new Wilder casino is being billed as a family-friendly destination, with plenty of activities and attractions for both adults and children. There will be a large gaming floor, as well as several restaurants and bars. The casino will also feature a luxury hotel with over 500 rooms.</p>
<p>According to developers, the Wilder casino will create thousands of jobs and bring in millions of dollars in revenue for the city of Las Vegas. Construction on the new casino is scheduled to begin in early 2019, with an opening date planned for late 2020.</p>

<p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/local/hamiltoncounty/2019/02/01/downtown-cincinnati-casinos-wilder-hollywood-star-casino/2742853002/" target="_blank">Cincinnati Enquirer</a>, there is a casino boom happening in downtown Cincinnati, as three new outlets are preparing to open in the next year. The most recent development is the planned opening of the Hollywood Star Casino, which is being built on the site of the former William H. Taft Hotel.</p>
<p>The Hollywood Star Casino will be operated by Wilder Entertainment, which also owns the Hollywood Casino in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. The new casino is expected to create 300 jobs and bring in $15 million in annual tax revenue to the city of Cincinnati. It will have 50 table games and 2,000 slot machines.</p>
<p>In addition to the Hollywood Star Casino, two other new casinos are expected to open in downtown Cincinnati soon. In early 2020, the $350 million Miami Valley Gaming &amp; Racing complex is scheduled to open, with 1,500 slot machines and 70 table games. And later in 2020, an $8 million casino called JACK Cincinnati Casino is scheduled to open in the former Macy’s building on Fountain Square.</p>
<p>The opening of these three new casinos represents a major expansion of gambling opportunities for residents of Cincinnati and its surrounding suburbs. The proximity of these casinos to each other is likely to lead to increased competition, with each casino vying for a bigger share of the local market. This could lead to increased marketing efforts and lower prices on gambling products.</p>
<p>It’s not clear yet how this casino boom will impact business at existing casinos in the region such as Newport Gaming &amp; Racing and Caesars Northern Kentucky Casino. But it’s likely that some customers will shift their spending from existing casinos to the new ones in downtown Cincinnati. This could lead to a decline in revenue for those existing casinos, although it’s too early to say for sure how significant that decline will be.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks like Cincinnati is set for a major expansion of its casino industry over the next year or so. This should provide a major boost to the local economy and create hundreds of jobs. It will be interesting to see how this plays out over time and whether these new casinos can continue thriving in such a competitive market</p>
<h1 id="Wilder-to-debut-multimillion-dollar-casino-in-downtown-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Wilder-to-debut-multimillion-dollar-casino-in-downtown-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Wilder to debut multimillion-dollar casino in downtown Las Vegas"></a>Wilder to debut multimillion-dollar casino in downtown Las Vegas</h1><p>Las Vegas is shaking things up again. Mayor Carolyn Goodman has just announced that Wilder Inc. will be opening their first multimillion-dollar casino in downtown Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The new casino, which is expected to open in late 2020, will be 28 stories high and have 1,500 gaming tables and slots. It will also include a luxury hotel, spa, and several restaurants.</p>
<p>“This new casino is going to add so much value to our city,” said Goodman. “It’s going to create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue.”</p>
<p>Wilder Inc. is a gaming company based out of Reno, Nevada. They already operate several casinos in the area, but this will be their first venture into Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Mayor Goodman was quick to point out that the new casino will be a boon for the local economy. “This project is expected to create more than 5,000 jobs,” she said. “And it will generate over $400 million in tax revenue for the state of Nevada.”</p>
<p> Gaming industry analysts are bullish on the new casino. “This could be a real game changer for downtown Las Vegas,” said one analyst. “Wilder is a well-respected company and they’re bringing a lot of firepower to the table.”</p>
<p>Others are more skeptical. “I just don’t see how this casino can compete with all of the other ones in town,” said one analyst. “The market is already saturated.”</p>
<p>Only time will tell who is right. In any case, there’s sure to be plenty of excitement in downtown Las Vegas when Wilder’s new casino opens its doors later this year.</p>
<h1 id="Wilder-announces-plans-for-new-casino-in-downtown-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Wilder-announces-plans-for-new-casino-in-downtown-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Wilder announces plans for new casino in downtown Las Vegas"></a>Wilder announces plans for new casino in downtown Las Vegas</h1><p>Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman yesterday announced plans for a new $4.8 billion casino resort in downtown Las Vegas. The development, to be known as Wilder Resort, is to be funded by the prominent Wilder family and will feature a hotel, casino, and numerous restaurants and shops.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be bringing this new development to downtown Las Vegas,” said Mayor Goodman. “The Wilder family has a long history in this city, and we know that they will create a world-class resort that will be a major attraction for visitors from all over the world.”</p>
<p>The casino will be located on 16 acres of land just south of the Fremont Street Experience. It will feature 2,000 slot machines, 125 gaming tables, and a 30,000-square-foot sportsbook. The hotel will have 650 rooms, while the complex will include 50 retail stores and 15 restaurants.</p>
<p>The new resort is scheduled to open in late 2021. In the meantime, the Wilder family is also planning to open a small casino on the property in early 2020. This will give people a taste of what’s to come and should help attract interest in the larger resort.</p>
