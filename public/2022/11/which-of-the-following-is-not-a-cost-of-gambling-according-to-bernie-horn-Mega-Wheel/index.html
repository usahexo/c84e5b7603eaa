The time and emotional toll that gambling can take on a person are also significant.</p>
<p>Gambling can be expensive. The amount of money people lose on gambling is staggering. In the United States, it is estimated that people lose more than $10 billion dollars each year on gambling activities. This does not include the money people spend on lottery tickets.</p>
<p>Gambling can also be costly in terms of the time people spend gambling. Many people gamble until they have no more money left to gamble with or they lose all their free time gambling. This can lead to problems in other areas of their life, such as work or school.</p>
<p>Emotional costs can be significant for people who gamble too much. Gambling can lead to feelings of anxiety, depression, and guilt. These negative emotions can exacerbate existing mental health issues and lead to other problems in a person’s life.</p>
<h1 id="Costs-of-Gambling"><a href="#Costs-of-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Costs of Gambling"></a>Costs of Gambling</h1><p>It is no secret that gambling can be a costly endeavor. Whether it is spending money on casino games, lotteries, or other forms of gambling, there is always the potential to lose quite a bit of money. In fact, the costs of gambling can be so steep that they can quickly become a major financial burden for players.</p>
<p>One of the most obvious costs of gambling is the amount of money that people spend while playing. This can include buying chips or tickets at a casino, betting at a race track, or making wagers with friends. While some people may be lucky enough to win money back, others lose everything they bet and then some. In fact, in 2016 Americans lost a staggering $117 billion on gambling activities!</p>
<p>Aside from the direct monetary losses, there are also other costs associated with gambling. These can include travel expenses to get to a casino or race track, as well as the purchase of food and drinks while playing. If someone becomes addicted to gambling, they may also end up spending more money than they can afford in an attempt to chase their losses.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the costs of gambling can be significant and often lead to significant financial harm for players. It is important to be aware of these costs before engaging in any type of gaming activity and to make sure that you have enough funds set aside to cover any potential losses.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Costs"><a href="#Gambling-Costs" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Costs"></a>Gambling Costs</h1><p>Gambling is a popular pastime, with people of all ages enjoying a flutter on the horses, in the casino or on the lottery. However, as well as being enjoyable, gambling can also be expensive, with the costs of gambling often underestimated.</p>
<p>The costs of gambling can come in a variety of forms, including financial costs, social costs and psychological costs. Financial costs can include spending money on gambling directly, as well as money lost due to unsuccessful bets. Social costs can include problems with relationships caused by gambling and time spent gambling instead of spending time with friends and family. Psychological costs can include problems such as anxiety and depression caused by gambling.</p>
<p>All these costs can add up to a lot of money over time and it is important to be aware of them before starting to gamble. Gambling should not be seen as a way to make money – more often than not, it ends up costing people money. If you are thinking about starting to gamble, it is important to weigh up the potential costs and benefits to make sure it is the right decision for you.</p>

<p>The answer is c) negative emotions. Gambling can produce a variety of negative consequences including anxiety, fear, stress, and depression.</p>
<h1 id="Bernie-Horn’s-Mega-Wheel-says-which-of-the-following-is-not-a-cost-of-gambling"><a href="#Bernie-Horn’s-Mega-Wheel-says-which-of-the-following-is-not-a-cost-of-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Bernie Horn’s Mega Wheel says which of the following is not a cost of gambling"></a>Bernie Horn’s Mega Wheel says which of the following is not a cost of gambling</h1><p>Bernie Horn was on a roll in the early 1990s. He had developed a computer program that could predict the outcome of casino games with amazing accuracy. </p>
<p>His invention, called the Mega Wheel, was the talk of the town and Bernie was making a fortune. But as is often the case with those who hit it big, Bernie’s luck soon ran out. </p>
<p>The Mega Wheel was a big hit with casino owners, but they didn’t like the idea that Bernie was using it to win money. They convinced him to let them borrow the machine and after a few weeks, they refused to give it back. </p>
<p>Bernie took them to court, but lost. The Mega Wheel ended up in the hands of the casinos and Bernie went bankrupt. </p>
<p>The Mega Wheel is still in use today and is considered by many to be the most accurate predicting device ever made. So accurate, in fact, that some casino owners refuse to let players use it for fear that they will lose too much money.</p>
