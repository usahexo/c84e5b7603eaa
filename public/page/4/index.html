<p>The casino’s popular “Buffalo Stampede” slot machine proved to be a major hit with gamblers, awarding four jackpots worth $300,000 each. In addition, over 2,000 other players won prizes of $10 or more.</p>
<p>Excalibur’s general manager, Joe Lupo, said that the casino was thrilled to see Buffalo win big. “Our Buffalo Stampede slot machine is one of our most popular games, and it’s great to see so many players winning big payouts.”</p>
<p>If you’re looking for some excitement and big payouts, be sure to visit Excalibur Resort and Casino!</p>
<h1 id="Buffalo-Beats-Detroit-Moves-On-to-Next-Round-of-Playoffs"><a href="#Buffalo-Beats-Detroit-Moves-On-to-Next-Round-of-Playoffs" class="headerlink" title="Buffalo Beats Detroit, Moves On to Next Round of Playoffs"></a>Buffalo Beats Detroit, Moves On to Next Round of Playoffs</h1><p>The Buffalo Bills have shocked the Detroit Lions and everyone watching, moving on to the next round of the playoffs after a 21-10 victory.</p>
<p>Lions quarterback Matt Stafford was under pressure all night, sacked three times and hit often, while Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor had a much easier night. Buffalo ran for 229 yards, with LeSean McCoy leading the way with 113 yards on just 17 carries.</p>
<p>Detroit’s lone touchdown came midway through the fourth quarter, when Stafford hit Golden Tate for an 8-yard TD pass. The Lions attempted an onside kick after that score, but Buffalo recovered easily.</p>
<p>With the victory, Buffalo will now travel to face the Jacksonville Jaguars in the next round of the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Excalibur-Welcomes-Buffalos-for-Home-Game-this-Weekend"><a href="#Excalibur-Welcomes-Buffalos-for-Home-Game-this-Weekend" class="headerlink" title="Excalibur Welcomes Buffalos for Home Game this Weekend"></a>Excalibur Welcomes Buffalos for Home Game this Weekend</h1><p>The Excalibur are set to welcome the Buffalo Bulls for their home game this weekend. The Bulls have had a rough start to their season, but the Excalibur are not taking them lightly.</p>
<p>The team is coming into this game with strong momentum, having won their last two games. Michael Dunigan has been a standout player, with an average of 21 points and 12 rebounds per game. They will need him and the rest of the team to continue playing at this level in order to take down the Bulls.</p>
<p>Buffalo has had some injuries that have affected their performance so far this year. Sophomore guard Lamonte Bearden is out with an ankle injury, and junior forward Willie Conner is out with a concussion. These players will be difficult to replace, but the Bulls still have some talented players on their roster.</p>
<p>Senior forward Shannon Evans II leads the team in scoring, averaging 19 points per game. He is also one of the most experienced players on the team, having played in 107 games over his four-year career. Junior forward C.J. Massinburg is also a key player for Buffalo, averaging 15 points and 7 rebounds per game.</p>
<p>The Excalibur have had trouble against Buffalo in the past, losing both of their meetings last season. However, they are confident that they can come out on top this time around. They will need to execute well on both offense and defense in order to win this game.</p>
<h1 id="Buffalo-to-Host-Detroit-at-Excalibur-in-Sports-Showdown"><a href="#Buffalo-to-Host-Detroit-at-Excalibur-in-Sports-Showdown" class="headerlink" title="Buffalo to Host Detroit at Excalibur in Sports Showdown"></a>Buffalo to Host Detroit at Excalibur in Sports Showdown</h1><p>The Buffalo Bisons and Detroit Tigers are set to square off in a sports showdown at Excalibur Arena on Saturday. The game is expected to be a hotly contested matchup between two of the top teams in their respective leagues.</p>
<p>Buffalo comes into the game with a record of 15-7, while Detroit is sporting a mark of 18-4. The Bisons have been one of the surprise teams in baseball this season, while the Tigers are considered to be one of the favorites to win the World Series.</p>
<p>Saturday’s showdown is sure to be a can’t-miss event for sports fans in Buffalo and Detroit. Tickets are already selling fast, so don’t miss your chance to see some of the best athletes in the world compete head-to-head.</p>
<h1 id="Which-Team-Will-Take-Home-the-Victory-Buffalo-or-Detroit"><a href="#Which-Team-Will-Take-Home-the-Victory-Buffalo-or-Detroit" class="headerlink" title="Which Team Will Take Home the Victory: Buffalo or Detroit?"></a>Which Team Will Take Home the Victory: Buffalo or Detroit?</h1><p>The Buffalo Bills and Detroit Lions will both be vying for the victory on Sunday. TheDetroit Lions have had a shaky season so far, but they are coming off of a win against the Carolina Panthers. The Buffalo Bills are looking to build on their momentum after they dominated the Miami Dolphins last week.</p>
<p>The key players to watch in this game are Matthew Stafford of the Detroit Lions and Tyrod Taylor of the Buffalo Bills. Stafford has been struggling with his accuracy this season, throwing eight interceptions in six games. If he can’t get his accuracy under control, the Buffalo Bills will take home the victory. Taylor, on the other hand, has been playing incredibly well this year. He is averaging 273 passing yards per game and has only thrown one interception thus far. If he continues to play at this level, the Buffalo Bills will be hard to beat.</p>
<p>Another player to watch is LeSean McCoy of the Buffalo Bills. He is averaging 5.4 yards per carry this season and has already scored five rushing touchdowns. If McCoy can continue to run well, it will open up opportunities for Taylor to make plays through the air.</p>
<p>The Detroit Lions have a strong defense, but they will ultimately be unable to stop the Buffalo Bills from taking home the victory on Sunday.</p>

        <h1 id="How-Much-Extra-Do-You-Have-to-Pay-When-Using-Your-Sea-Pass-Card-in-the-Casino"><a href="#How-Much-Extra-Do-You-Have-to-Pay-When-Using-Your-Sea-Pass-Card-in-the-Casino" class="headerlink" title="How Much Extra Do You Have to Pay When Using Your Sea Pass Card in the Casino?"></a>How Much Extra Do You Have to Pay When Using Your Sea Pass Card in the Casino?</h1><p>A lot of people like to spend time in the casino while on a cruise, and many use their Sea Pass card to do so. But is there an extra cost to using your Sea Pass card in the casino?</p>
<p>The answer is yes - there is an extra cost associated with using your Sea Pass card in the casino. However, it’s not a significant amount, and most people won’t even notice it.</p>
<p>The cost is simply 2 percent of the total purchase amount. So, if you purchase $100 worth of chips using your Sea Pass card, you’ll be charged an additional $2.</p>
<p>This cost is in addition to any other costs that may be associated with playing in the casino, such as gambling taxes and fees. So, be sure to factor that into your calculations when deciding whether or not to use your Sea Pass card in the casino.</p>
<p>In most cases, using your Sea Pass card in the casino is a convenient way to make your transactions. You won’t have to worry about carrying any money around with you, and you’ll know exactly how much you’re spending each time you play. Just be sure to keep in mind the additional cost associated with using your Sea Pass card.</p>
<h1 id="Casino-Doubles-Salary-for-One-Year-for-Slot-Players-Who-Use-a-Sea-Pass-Card"><a href="#Casino-Doubles-Salary-for-One-Year-for-Slot-Players-Who-Use-a-Sea-Pass-Card" class="headerlink" title="Casino Doubles Salary for One Year for Slot Players Who Use a Sea Pass Card"></a>Casino Doubles Salary for One Year for Slot Players Who Use a Sea Pass Card</h1><p>Casino workers in Yokohama, Japan, will get a raise next year, but only the ones who use a Sea Pass card to play slot machines. The casino is doubling their salary for one year for those who use the card.</p>
<p>The promotion is an effort by the casino to increase tourism from South Korea. South Koreans love to visit casinos, and the hope is that more of them will come to Yokohama if they know that their fellow countrymen are getting special treatment.</p>
<p>Sea Pass cards are pre-paid cards that can be used at different businesses in South Korea, including restaurants, convenience stores, and of course, casinos. They’re very popular among tourists, and the Yokohama casino is hoping to cash in on that by offering the extra incentive of doubling salaries.</p>
<p>The offer is good for all of 2019, so it’s definitely worth considering if you’re planning a trip to Japan next year. Keep in mind that you do have to actually be employed at the casino to qualify for the raise – so if you’re just a tourist passing through, you’re out of luck!</p>

<p>Some of the best perks of having a Sea Pass card include free stays in the hotel and $10 in free cash each day. You can also get discounted rates on food, drinks, and even spa services.

The news was announced earlier today in a post on the casino’s website, where it was also made clear that all pending withdrawals will be processed and paid out as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The closure comes as a bit of a surprise, as Vavada only launched at the beginning of this year. It’s been one of the more popular online casinos around, thanks in no small part to its generous welcome bonuses and wide range of games.</p>
<p>The post on the site doesn’t give any reason for the closure, simply stating that “the time has come”. It’s unclear if this is due to financial difficulties or some other problem, but one thing is for sure – players are going to be disappointed.</p>
<p>It’s not all bad news though, as those who have funds in their accounts can still withdraw them before 10 PM tonight. After that point, Vavada will be closed for good and players will lose any money they have left there.</p>
<p>So if you’re a player at Vavada, make sure you get your money out before it’s too late!</p>

The decision to close up shop was not an easy one, but due to circumstances beyond our control, we are regrettably no longer able to offer our gaming services.</p>
<p>The last day of operation will be Wednesday, September 12th, and all players are kindly requested to finish any games they may have open by 9:45 PM tonight.</p>
<p>We would like to take this opportunity to thank all our loyal players for their support over the years. It’s been a pleasure serving you, and we hope you’ll continue to enjoy our other products.</p>

<p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/local/hamiltoncounty/2019/02/01/downtown-cincinnati-casinos-wilder-hollywood-star-casino/2742853002/" target="_blank">Cincinnati Enquirer</a>, there is a casino boom happening in downtown Cincinnati, as three new outlets are preparing to open in the next year. The most recent development is the planned opening of the Hollywood Star Casino, which is being built on the site of the former William H. Taft Hotel.</p>
<p>The Hollywood Star Casino will be operated by Wilder Entertainment, which also owns the Hollywood Casino in Lawrenceburg, Indiana. The new casino is expected to create 300 jobs and bring in $15 million in annual tax revenue to the city of Cincinnati. It will have 50 table games and 2,000 slot machines.</p>
<p>In addition to the Hollywood Star Casino, two other new casinos are expected to open in downtown Cincinnati soon. In early 2020, the $350 million Miami Valley Gaming &amp; Racing complex is scheduled to open, with 1,500 slot machines and 70 table games. And later in 2020, an $8 million casino called JACK Cincinnati Casino is scheduled to open in the former Macy’s building on Fountain Square.</p>
<p>The opening of these three new casinos represents a major expansion of gambling opportunities for residents of Cincinnati and its surrounding suburbs. The proximity of these casinos to each other is likely to lead to increased competition, with each casino vying for a bigger share of the local market. This could lead to increased marketing efforts and lower prices on gambling products.</p>
<p>It’s not clear yet how this casino boom will impact business at existing casinos in the region such as Newport Gaming &amp; Racing and Caesars Northern Kentucky Casino. But it’s likely that some customers will shift their spending from existing casinos to the new ones in downtown Cincinnati. This could lead to a decline in revenue for those existing casinos, although it’s too early to say for sure how significant that decline will be.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks like Cincinnati is set for a major expansion of its casino industry over the next year or so. This should provide a major boost to the local economy and create hundreds of jobs. It will be interesting to see how this plays out over time and whether these new casinos can continue thriving in such a competitive market</p>
<h1 id="Wilder-to-debut-multimillion-dollar-casino-in-downtown-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Wilder-to-debut-multimillion-dollar-casino-in-downtown-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Wilder to debut multimillion-dollar casino in downtown Las Vegas"></a>Wilder to debut multimillion-dollar casino in downtown Las Vegas</h1><p>Las Vegas is shaking things up again. Mayor Carolyn Goodman has just announced that Wilder Inc. will be opening their first multimillion-dollar casino in downtown Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The new casino, which is expected to open in late 2020, will be 28 stories high and have 1,500 gaming tables and slots. It will also include a luxury hotel, spa, and several restaurants.</p>
<p>“This new casino is going to add so much value to our city,” said Goodman. “It’s going to create jobs and bring in much-needed revenue.”</p>
<p>Wilder Inc. is a gaming company based out of Reno, Nevada. They already operate several casinos in the area, but this will be their first venture into Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Mayor Goodman was quick to point out that the new casino will be a boon for the local economy. “This project is expected to create more than 5,000 jobs,” she said. “And it will generate over $400 million in tax revenue for the state of Nevada.”</p>
<p> Gaming industry analysts are bullish on the new casino. “This could be a real game changer for downtown Las Vegas,” said one analyst. “Wilder is a well-respected company and they’re bringing a lot of firepower to the table.”</p>
<p>Others are more skeptical. “I just don’t see how this casino can compete with all of the other ones in town,” said one analyst. “The market is already saturated.”</p>
<p>Only time will tell who is right. In any case, there’s sure to be plenty of excitement in downtown Las Vegas when Wilder’s new casino opens its doors later this year.</p>
<h1 id="Wilder-announces-plans-for-new-casino-in-downtown-Las-Vegas"><a href="#Wilder-announces-plans-for-new-casino-in-downtown-Las-Vegas" class="headerlink" title="Wilder announces plans for new casino in downtown Las Vegas"></a>Wilder announces plans for new casino in downtown Las Vegas</h1><p>Las Vegas Mayor Carolyn Goodman yesterday announced plans for a new $4.8 billion casino resort in downtown Las Vegas. The development, to be known as Wilder Resort, is to be funded by the prominent Wilder family and will feature a hotel, casino, and numerous restaurants and shops.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be bringing this new development to downtown Las Vegas,” said Mayor Goodman. “The Wilder family has a long history in this city, and we know that they will create a world-class resort that will be a major attraction for visitors from all over the world.”</p>
<p>The casino will be located on 16 acres of land just south of the Fremont Street Experience. It will feature 2,000 slot machines, 125 gaming tables, and a 30,000-square-foot sportsbook. The hotel will have 650 rooms, while the complex will include 50 retail stores and 15 restaurants.</p>
<p>The new resort is scheduled to open in late 2021. In the meantime, the Wilder family is also planning to open a small casino on the property in early 2020. This will give people a taste of what’s to come and should help attract interest in the larger resort.</p>

It also includes a new landmass modelled after Cyrodiil with all of its dungeons, cities and inhabitants.</p>
<p>The team behind Skyblivion has stated that they do not plan to release a beta version of the game and that their focus is on releasing a complete and polished product. This is good news for fans of Oblivion who have been waiting over 7 years for a new game in the series.</p>

<p>The closure of the Hard Rock and Roll Casino comes as a surprise to many, as the casino has been one of the most popular gambling destinations in the Tampa Bay area. The casino’s closure is also expected to have a negative impact on the local economy, as it will leave nearly 1,000 employees without jobs.</p>
<p>There are several reasons behind the Hard Rock and Roll Casino’s decision to close its doors. First and foremost, competition from other casinos in the area has taken a toll on business. In addition, the casino has faced increasing costs associated with regulation and security.</p>
<p>It is unclear what will happen to the property once the casino closes. Some people are speculating that it will be turned into a residential development, while others believe that it could be converted into a hotel or conference center. Whatever happens, it is clear that the Hard Rock and Roll Casino will not be around much longer.</p>
