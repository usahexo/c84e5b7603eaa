#  What is vigorish in Las Vegas sports bets and how does it work?

In gambling, vigorish (also known as the "vig" or the "juice") is the commission that the bookmaker takes for arranging a wager. It is usually expressed as a percentage of the bet, and is paid to the house regardless of the outcome of the bet. In most cases, it is collected before any winnings are paid out to winning bettors.

The vigorish compensates the house for guaranteeing against gambler losses, and ensures a profit for the house in any event. It also encourages bookmakers to set odds that will be attractive to gamblers, as they must make up for their own losses with this portion of each bet.

In Las Vegas sports betting, vigorish is typically 10% on straight bets and 5% on parlays. This means that a gambler who bets $110 on a straight outcome (e.g., Team A to beat Team B) would have to win $121 (not including taxes) to break even; meanwhile, a gambler who bets $11 on a two-team parlay would have to win $16 (again, not including taxes) to break even.

#  How to calculate the vigorish in Las Vegas sports bets 

The vigorish, or juice as it is more commonly known, is the percentage of the bet that the bookmaker takes. It is essentially their commission for facilitating the transaction. The percentage varies from sport to sport, and from bookmaker to bookmaker, but is typically in the region of 10%.

This means that if you were to place a $100 bet on a team with a -110 odds, then you would win $90.91 (including your original stake) if that team won. If you were to lose your bet, then you would lose your full $100 stake.

Some sportsbooks also offer reduced juice, which essentially means that they take a smaller commission on bets. This can be beneficial to punters as it increases their chances of making a profit. For example, if you were to place a $100 bet at -105 odds, then you would only win $95 should your team win (including your original stake).

#  How to find the best vigorish in Las Vegas sports bets 
In this article, we will explore how to identify and take advantage of the best vigorish in Las Vegas sports bets. We will cover what vigorish is, how to find it and factors that contribute to its amount. 

Vigorish, also commonly known as "juice" or "the vig", is the commission that bookmakers charge on each wager. The amount of vigorish can vary greatly from one book to another and often depends on the popularity of the sport and the betting market. 

When looking for the best vigorish, it's important to consider a number of factors:
-The popularity of the sport: Sports that have higher odds usually have a smaller vigorish. For example, in golf there are typically fewer bets placed compared to football, so the vigorish on golf bets will be higher. Conversely, in sports like football where there are more bets placed, the vigorish will be lower. 
-The betting market: In some cases, books may offer different lines in order to attract more bettors. For example, a book may offer a -110 line on one team while another book offers -115. In this scenario, it would make sense to bet at the book offering -110 because you're getting better odds and avoiding the extra juice (assuming you believe that team is going to win). 
-Location: The cost of doing business varies from state to state and city to city. This is reflected in the amount of vigorish charged by local books. 
-Bookmaker: Not all books are created equal when it comes to vigorish. Some bookmakers are more advantageous than others when it comes to setting lines and avoiding juice. 

Finding the best vigorish can be time consuming but if done correctly can lead to increased profits when betting on sports in Las Vegas.

#  What is the average vigorish in Las Vegas sports bets ? 

The average vigorish in Las Vegas sports bets is about 4.5%. This is the percentage that the casino charges for taking a bet. So, for every $100 bet, the casino would take $4.50 and pay out the rest to the winning bettor.

#  Vigorish in Las Vegas sports bets - how to make the most money!

When you’re betting on sports in Las Vegas, it’s important to understand the vigorish - also known as the juice. This is the commission that the house takes on each bet. In essence, it’s how the casino makes its money.

So, how can you make sure you’re getting the best value on your bets? Well, there are a few things you can do.

First of all, always shop around for the best odds. Don’t just bet with the first bookmaker you come across - compare the different offers and see where you can get the best value.

Secondly, try to avoid making parlay bets. These are bets where you combine several outcomes into one bet, and as a result, the payout is lower than if you’d placed each bet individually.

Finally, make sure you know how the commission works. In most cases, it will be based on your original stake rather than your winnings. So even if your team doesn’t triumph in their match, you could still lose some money if you haven’t factored in the vigorish.
