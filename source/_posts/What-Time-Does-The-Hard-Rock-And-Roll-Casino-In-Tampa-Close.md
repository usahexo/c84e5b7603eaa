#  The Hard Rock And Roll Casino In Tampa Closing Time

The Hard Rock and Roll Casino in Tampa is set to close its doors in early 2020. The casino has been a staple in the Tampa Bay community for over two decades, but it seems that its time has come to an end.

The closure of the Hard Rock and Roll Casino comes as a surprise to many, as the casino has been one of the most popular gambling destinations in the Tampa Bay area. The casino’s closure is also expected to have a negative impact on the local economy, as it will leave nearly 1,000 employees without jobs.

There are several reasons behind the Hard Rock and Roll Casino’s decision to close its doors. First and foremost, competition from other casinos in the area has taken a toll on business. In addition, the casino has faced increasing costs associated with regulation and security.

It is unclear what will happen to the property once the casino closes. Some people are speculating that it will be turned into a residential development, while others believe that it could be converted into a hotel or conference center. Whatever happens, it is clear that the Hard Rock and Roll Casino will not be around much longer.
