#  How Many Four of a Sort Hands are There in Poker?

If you’re playing poker, there are only 52 cards in the deck and you want to know how many different hands you can make, use this simple math:

There are 4 suits of 13 cards each. So, 52 ÷ 4 = 13.

This means that there are 13 different four-of-a-kind hands in poker.

#  How Many Four of a Sort Hands are in Texas Hold'em Poker? 

There are a total of 4,096 different combinations of Four of a Sort hands in Texas Hold'em Poker. 

Four of a kind hands are hands which contain four cards of the same rank. In poker, these are often abbreviated to "4ofAK". 

The rank of each card is important for making Four of a Kind combinations. In most variants of poker, the rank of the Ace is high, followed by King, Queen, Jack, 10, 9 and so on down to 2. However, in some variants (such as Razz), the Ace is low, ranking below 2. 

This means that there are actually two different types of Four of a Kind hands: 

   4 Aces (or any other 4 Aces) 
4 Kings (or any other 4 Kings)
etc...

  and:

4 Deuces (or any other 4 Deuces)
4 Treys (or any other 4 Treys)
etc...

 Out of the 4,096 possible Four of a Kind hands, there are 1,024 that consist purely of Aces, 1,024 that consist purely of Kings etc. The remaining 2,048 Four of a Kind hands are made up from two different ranks e.g. 3 Aces and 2 Kings would be a Four of a Kind hand.

#  What is the Probability of Getting Four of a Sort in Poker? 

A poker player’s chances of getting four of a kind vary depending on the game being played and the number of cards being used. However, the probability of getting any given hand is usually about 1 in 21,000. This means that it is extremely rare to get four of a kind, and the odds of doing so are approximately 4.8%.

This calculation can be slightly different in other variants of poker, but the probability of getting four of a kind is generally around 5%. In games like Texas Hold ‘Em or Omaha Hi-Lo, there are more possible card combinations, so the odds of getting four of a kind are lower. In 7-Card Stud or Draw Poker, there are fewer possible combinations, so the odds are higher. 

But no matter what game is being played, the chance of getting four matching cards is still pretty slim. For example, in a game with 2 cards (like Deuces Wild), the probability of getting four of a kind is only 0.3%. This means that out of every 1,000 hands played, only three will result in four matching cards.

#  How to Figure Out the Number of Four of a Sort Hands in Poker 

In poker, a four of a kind is a hand consisting of all four cards of the same rank, such as 4♥4♦4♣ (quadruple) or A♠A♥A♦K♠ (straight flush).

This article will show you how to calculate the number of hands possible for each rank, given that there are 52 cards in a deck and that each rank occurs once. This will help you figure out the likelihood of getting certain hands in poker.

There are 4 different suits (spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds), so there are 4 ^ 4 = 256 possible four of a kind hands.

There are 13 ranks (2 through 10, J-Q-K-A), so there are 13 ^ 4 = 16,384 possible four of a kind hands.

There are 1,296 different straight flushes (A♥ 2♦ 3♥ 4♣ 5♦ 6♥ 7♣ 8♥ 9♣ 10♥ J♦ Q♦ K♦ A♦), so there are 1,296 / 4 = 324 possible four of a kind hands with at least one ace.

There are 552 different ways to get two pair (AABCD, 22JJQK, etc.), so there are 552 / 4 = 138 possible four of a kind hands with two pairs. 

There are 3 ways to get three of a kind (AAA, 222, 333), so there are 3 / 4 = 0.75 possible four of a kind hands with three of a kind. 

So altogether, there are 16,912 possible four of a kind hands in poker.

#  What Affects the Chances of Getting Four of a Sort in Poker?

There are a lot of things that go into making poker decisions, and some factors are more important than others. When it comes to getting four of a sort, there are three main things to take into account: the rank of your four cards, the rank of the other players’ cards, and the number of players in the hand.

# The Rank of Your Four Cards

The first thing to consider is the rank of your four cards. This will determine how likely it is that you will actually get four of a kind. For example, if you have four Aces, your chances are much better than if you have four 7s.

# The Rank of the Other Players’ Cards

The second thing to consider is the rank of the other players’ cards. This will determine how likely it is that someone else will have four of a kind. For example, if all of the other players have 4s or lower, your chances are much higher than if all of the other players have 10s or higher.

# The Number of Players in the Hand
 
Lastly, you need to consider the number of players in the hand. This will determine how likely it is that someone else will also have four of a kind. For example, if there are only two other players in the hand, your chances are twice as high as if there are six other players in the hand.
