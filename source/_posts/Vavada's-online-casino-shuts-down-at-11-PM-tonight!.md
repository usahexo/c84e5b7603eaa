#  Vavada's online casino closes at 10:30 PM tonight!

It is with great sadness that we must announce the closure of Vavada's online casino.

All games and services will be unavailable from 10:30 PM tonight, EST. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and want to thank everyone for their support over the years.

#  Time's up for Vavada's online casino – it shuts down at 10 PM tonight!

Online casino Vavada is about to close its doors for good. The news was announced earlier today in a post on the casino's website, where it was also made clear that all pending withdrawals will be processed and paid out as soon as possible.

The closure comes as a bit of a surprise, as Vavada only launched at the beginning of this year. It's been one of the more popular online casinos around, thanks in no small part to its generous welcome bonuses and wide range of games.

The post on the site doesn't give any reason for the closure, simply stating that "the time has come". It's unclear if this is due to financial difficulties or some other problem, but one thing is for sure – players are going to be disappointed.

It's not all bad news though, as those who have funds in their accounts can still withdraw them before 10 PM tonight. After that point, Vavada will be closed for good and players will lose any money they have left there.

So if you're a player at Vavada, make sure you get your money out before it's too late!

#  Sorry, gamblers – Vavada's online casino is shutting down at 9:45 PM tonight!

It's with a heavy heart that we must announce the closure of Vavada, our online casino. The decision to close up shop was not an easy one, but due to circumstances beyond our control, we are regrettably no longer able to offer our gaming services.

The last day of operation will be Wednesday, September 12th, and all players are kindly requested to finish any games they may have open by 9:45 PM tonight.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank all our loyal players for their support over the years. It's been a pleasure serving you, and we hope you'll continue to enjoy our other products.

Sincerely,
The Vavada Team
