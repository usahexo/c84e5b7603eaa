#  How Much Extra Do You Have to Pay When Using Your Sea Pass Card in the Casino? 

A lot of people like to spend time in the casino while on a cruise, and many use their Sea Pass card to do so. But is there an extra cost to using your Sea Pass card in the casino?

The answer is yes - there is an extra cost associated with using your Sea Pass card in the casino. However, it's not a significant amount, and most people won't even notice it.

The cost is simply 2 percent of the total purchase amount. So, if you purchase $100 worth of chips using your Sea Pass card, you'll be charged an additional $2.

This cost is in addition to any other costs that may be associated with playing in the casino, such as gambling taxes and fees. So, be sure to factor that into your calculations when deciding whether or not to use your Sea Pass card in the casino.

In most cases, using your Sea Pass card in the casino is a convenient way to make your transactions. You won't have to worry about carrying any money around with you, and you'll know exactly how much you're spending each time you play. Just be sure to keep in mind the additional cost associated with using your Sea Pass card.

#  Casino Doubles Salary for One Year for Slot Players Who Use a Sea Pass Card 

Casino workers in Yokohama, Japan, will get a raise next year, but only the ones who use a Sea Pass card to play slot machines. The casino is doubling their salary for one year for those who use the card.
