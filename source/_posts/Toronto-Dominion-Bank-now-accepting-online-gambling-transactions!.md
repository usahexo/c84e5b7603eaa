#  RBC and Scotiabank come out in support of online gambling

The last few years has seen a dramatic increase in the number of people who gamble online. This is partially due to the fact that it’s become easier than ever to access online casinos and sportsbooks from anywhere in the world.

This trend has not gone unnoticed by Canada’s two largest banks, RBC and Scotiabank. this week, both banks announced their support for online gambling in Canada.

RBC released a statement saying that it believes “online gambling should be offered in a safe, legal and responsible manner.” The bank went on to say that it plans to work with provincial governments and other stakeholders to ensure that online gambling is offered in a responsible way.

Scotiabank was less specific about its plans, simply stating that it supports online gambling and will work with government and other stakeholders to make sure it’s offered in a responsible way.

It will be interesting to see what comes of RBC and Scotiabank’s announcements. It’s possible that they could lobby for new laws or regulations that would make it easier for Canadians to gamble online. Alternatively, they could simply work with the provinces to make sure that existing laws are enforced properly.
