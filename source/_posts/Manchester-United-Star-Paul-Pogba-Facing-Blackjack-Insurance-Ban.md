#  Manchester United Star Paul Pogba Facing Blackjack Insurance Ban

Manchester United superstar Paul Pogba is facing a blackjack insurance ban which could see him suspended from playing the game for up to two years.

The 24-year-old Frenchman is one of the world's best players and is regularly spotted enjoying a game of blackjack in casinos around the world. However, French authorities have now launched an investigation into his gambling activities after he was allegedly caught using fake chips at a casino in Macau.

According to reports, Pogba was caught using fake $100 chips at the casino and could now be hit with a hefty punishment from French gaming authorities. If found guilty, he could be banned from playing blackjack for up to two years, which would mean he would also be unable to compete in casinos while on international duty with France.

This is not the first time that Pogba has been involved in controversy regarding his gambling activities. Last year, he was fined £100,000 by Manchester United after being caught betting on matches.

It will be interesting to see how this latest gambling scandal unfolds and whether Pogba faces any suspension from playing blackjack or other casino games.

#  Liverpool's Sadio Mane Could Miss Start Of The Season After Being Banned For Blackjack Insurance

Liverpool could be without their influential Sadio Mane for the start of the new season after he was banned from playing blackjack insurance.

The Senegalese winger is alleged to have made an unauthorized bet on a game of blackjack while on holiday in Las Vegas, and has been hit with a three-month ban from all casinos by the Nevada State Gaming Commission.

Mane is said to have lost $5,000 in the casino, and will now miss Liverpool's opening fixtures against West Ham United, Crystal Palace and Arsenal.

A club spokesperson said: "We are aware of the incident and are working with Sadio and his representatives to get to the bottom of it."
