#  Excalibur Welcomes Buffalos for Home Game this Weekend

The Excalibur are set to welcome the Buffalo Bulls for their home game this weekend. The Bulls have had a rough start to their season, but the Excalibur are not taking them lightly.

The team is coming into this game with strong momentum, having won their last two games. Michael Dunigan has been a standout player, with an average of 21 points and 12 rebounds per game. They will need him and the rest of the team to continue playing at this level in order to take down the Bulls.

Buffalo has had some injuries that have affected their performance so far this year. Sophomore guard Lamonte Bearden is out with an ankle injury, and junior forward Willie Conner is out with a concussion. These players will be difficult to replace, but the Bulls still have some talented players on their roster.

Senior forward Shannon Evans II leads the team in scoring, averaging 19 points per game. He is also one of the most experienced players on the team, having played in 107 games over his four-year career. Junior forward C.J. Massinburg is also a key player for Buffalo, averaging 15 points and 7 rebounds per game.

The Excalibur have had trouble against Buffalo in the past, losing both of their meetings last season. However, they are confident that they can come out on top this time around. They will need to execute well on both offense and defense in order to win this game.

#  Which Team Will Take Home the Victory: Buffalo or Detroit?

The Buffalo Bills and Detroit Lions will both be vying for the victory on Sunday. TheDetroit Lions have had a shaky season so far, but they are coming off of a win against the Carolina Panthers. The Buffalo Bills are looking to build on their momentum after they dominated the Miami Dolphins last week.

The key players to watch in this game are Matthew Stafford of the Detroit Lions and Tyrod Taylor of the Buffalo Bills. Stafford has been struggling with his accuracy this season, throwing eight interceptions in six games. If he can't get his accuracy under control, the Buffalo Bills will take home the victory. Taylor, on the other hand, has been playing incredibly well this year. He is averaging 273 passing yards per game and has only thrown one interception thus far. If he continues to play at this level, the Buffalo Bills will be hard to beat.

Another player to watch is LeSean McCoy of the Buffalo Bills. He is averaging 5.4 yards per carry this season and has already scored five rushing touchdowns. If McCoy can continue to run well, it will open up opportunities for Taylor to make plays through the air.

The Detroit Lions have a strong defense, but they will ultimately be unable to stop the Buffalo Bills from taking home the victory on Sunday.
