#  How Long Do Poker Games Last? Kansas City Royals Edition 

Assuming a poker game of eight players with equal chip starting stacks, and no antes, how long would you expect the average poker game to last?

There are a lot of variables at play when answering this question - the number of players, the ante, the blinds, the type of poker game being played - but we can still get a pretty good idea.

A study by ThePoker1000 looked at 10 different types of poker games, with various numbers of players and bet sizes. They found that the average length of a poker game was 3.7 hours.

One interesting tidbit from their study? Omaha Hi-Lo tends to be longer than other types of poker games, with an average game time of 4.5 hours. So if you're looking for a marathon game, try playing some Omaha Hi-Lo! 

In general though, most poker games will last around 3 or 4 hours. Of course, there are always exceptions - especially in high stakes games - but that's a good rule of thumb. 

Now that we know how long to expect a standard poker game to last, let's take a look at how long Kansas City Royals games tend to go.

So if you're looking to squeeze in a quick game of poker while the Royals are on TV, you're probably out of luck. But if you have some time to kill and want to watch some classic slow-paced baseball action, then the Royals are your team!
