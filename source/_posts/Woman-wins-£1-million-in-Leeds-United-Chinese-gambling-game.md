The Chinese gambling game Mahjong is a big hit with Leeds United fans. The game is easy to learn and can be played while watching the match.

Mahjong is a tile-based game that has been popular in China for centuries. The object of the game is to remove all of the tiles from the board by selecting pairs of identical tiles.

Leeds United fans have adopted Mahjong as their unofficial game, and it can be seen being played in the stands at most home games. The game is easy to learn and can be played while watching the match.

There are many variations of Mahjong, but the basic rules are the same. The following steps will help you get started:

1) Choose a player to start the game. This player is known as the east wind.

2) Place all of the tiles in a square container, face down.

3) Draw four tiles and place them in a row, face up. These tiles are known as flowers or simples.

4) Choose one of the flowers and discard it into another player’s pile. This player then takes a tile from the container and places it in front of them, facing up.

5) If you cannot match any of your tiles, you must draw another tile from the container and replace one of your existing tiles. If you draw a flower, you must replace it with another flower from your hand. If you draw a season, you must replace it with another season from your hand etc…
