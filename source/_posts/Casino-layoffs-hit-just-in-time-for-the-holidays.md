#  Casino layoffs hit just in time for the holidays

Casino layoffs are hitting just in time for the holidays.

The Atlantic City casino layoff news comes as a surprise to many, with just a month to go before Christmas. Workers at several of the city’s casinos have been given notice that their positions are being eliminated.

Among the casinos affected are the Borgata, Caesars, Harrah’s, and Tropicana. Approximately 1,000 employees will be laid off as a result of the cuts.

The move is seen as an attempt by the casinos to reduce costs in light of increased competition from neighboring states. Pennsylvania, New York, and Delaware all have casinos that are taking business away from Atlantic City establishments.

In addition to the layoffs, some casinos are also reducing hours and eliminating benefits for workers.

The news of the layoffs has not gone over well with casino workers or their unions. Many feel that they were not given enough notice to prepare for the loss of their jobs. Some workers are even threatening to sue the casinos.

Layoffs at this time of year are sure to cause hardship for many families. The Christmas season is already a difficult time for those who are out of work. The added stress of finding a new job just before Christmas will only make things worse.

It is hoped that the casinos will reconsider their decision to lay off workers and that some sort of last-minute agreement can be reached. However, at this point it does not appear that there is much hope for that happening.

#  Casino staff protest cuts by walking out

Around 300 casino workers staged a walk out Wednesday, protesting the recent announcement of layoffs and wage cuts.

The staff walked out at the Wynn casino in Everett, just outside of Boston. They are outraged over the recent cuts that will see many workers take home less pay, and some losing their jobs entirely.

"It's a shame," said one worker who asked to remain anonymous. "They're asking us to take a pay cut when our profits are up. It doesn't make sense."

The workers are represented by UNITE HERE Local 26. In a statement, they said that the walkout was in protest of "Wynn's decision to layoff and drastically reduce wages for 300 of its best-paid employees."

In a statement released Wednesday, Wynn Resorts said that it was "disappointed" that the workers had chosen to stage a walk out instead of negotiating. The company went on to say that it is committed to working with its employees "to reach common ground."

"We are disappointed that our valued team members have decided to walk out after we made an agreement with them to discuss their concerns," read the statement. "We remain committed to working with them to find common ground as we continue our discussions about how we can improve our business together."

The staff at the Wynn casino aren't the only ones protesting wage cuts this week. Workers at 30 other hotels and casinos in Las Vegas also staged a walk out on Tuesday, protesting similar cuts.

#  Casino workers demand better severance packages

 labour unions representing casino workers in the United States are demanding better severance packages from casino operators. The demand for improved severance comes as casinos face increasing competition from neighbouring states and automated gaming machines.

In a statement, the unions said that they wanted casino operators to set aside money for workers who lost their jobs due to the increased competition. They added that the money should be enough to cover at least three months’ salary.

The unions also criticised casino operators for not doing enough to protect jobs in the industry. They said that many of the jobs lost were due to automation, and not competition from other states.

Casino operators have reacted negatively to the union’s demands, with some officials accusing the labourers of putting their own interests ahead of those of casinos and their employees. However, the unions say that they are only trying to ensure that workers are treated fairly in an increasingly competitive environment.

#  Union leaders threaten to shut down casino over gambling cuts

The leader of the casino workers' union has threatened to shut down the gambling operation if the government goes ahead with proposed cuts to their wages.

"We will not stand for this," said the union leader. "We will close the casino down if these cuts are implemented."

The government is proposing a wage cut of 10% for all casino workers. This would amount to a reduction in pay of $2000 per year for the average worker.

The union leader said that the workers are prepared to take whatever action is necessary to protect their wages and jobs. "We will fight until the end," he said. "There is no way we are going to let them get away with these cuts."

Casino workers have been protesting against the wage cuts outside of the legislature. The protesters have been vocal, with some chanting "shut it down" and "no justice, no peace".

The government has said that it is necessary to impose the wage cuts in order to keep the casino financially viable. It has also argued that the workers are being paid well above what is considered a livable wage.

The casino employs 2000 people, most of whom are expected to be affected by the wage cuts.

#  Casino announces closure, blames government for gambling cuts

The management of the Casino has announced that it is to close with immediate effect blaming the government for cuts in gambling duty.

In a statement, the Casino said that "the decision to close is a direct result of the government's decision to reduce the duty on gaming machines by 10%."

The closure will leave around 190 people out of work.
